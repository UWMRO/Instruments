continuously polling with the GetStatus function. If you wish to restart the calling thread 
without waiting for an Acquisition event, call the function CancelWait.
An Acquisition Event occurs each time a new image is acquired during an Accumulation, 
Kinetic Series or Run-Till-Abort acquisition or at the end of a Single Scan Acquisition.
If a second event occurs before the first one has been acknowledged, the first one will be 
ignored. Care should be taken in this case, as you may have to use CancelWait to exit
